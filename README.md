# MinecoloniesQuestInstaller
A simple mod for installing my [minecolonies questline](https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/minecolonies-questline-ftb-quests/) chapter. This is quest for FTB Quests that is intended to explain to new players how to play Minecolonies and provide some useful information to new and returning users.

## Safe Edits
The mod only copies the config files to the appropriate folders if they do not exist. If files already exist at the specified locations nothing is overwritten.

## Mod Dependencies
* Minecolonies
* FTB Quests
* Kubejs

## Build
`.\gradlew build`   

## Output
`/build/libs/questinstaller-x.x.x.jar`
